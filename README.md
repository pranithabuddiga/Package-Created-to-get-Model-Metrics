# Package-Created-to-get-Model-Metrics

I created this package to calculate the model metrics to evaluate the model performance. Refer to the document for further details.This package contains function to compute model metrics like MAD, MSE, MAPE for numeric predictor variable and also to compute the binary model metrics like Log-likelihood, AIC, BIC. Place this tar file in your working directory and then install the package to use the functionality.
